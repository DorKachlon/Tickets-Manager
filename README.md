## My extra Features

-   Can change ticket to be done / undone.
-   You can search for tickets by email or by content.
-   tickets can be deleted, and also returned from the trash if needed.
-   I added a menu that opens on the left through, which you can switch channels, such as:
    -   A channel where only the done tickets can be seen.
    -   A channel where only the undone tickets can be seen.
    -   And a channel where you can see all the deleted tickets.
-   I added a "see more" feature so that the long tabs do not occupy the entire screen.
